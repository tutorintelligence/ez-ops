# ez-parser
This library is a simple wrapper around the Python Argparse library, especially useful for large, devops codebases with many command-tools. It tries to abstract away much of the argparse complexity, lack of typing, and repeated boilerplate code. It also adds visualization to help messages for users trying to navigate complex command-line tools.
